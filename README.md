## Answers to questions

The sequence is not correct. All bracket must be paired. We need to balance brackets by removing one open round bracket or adding another closed round bracket at the end before the square bracket. We also need to remove last square bracket or add one at the beginning. Examples: [(())()(())], [((())()(()))], [[((())()(()))]]
